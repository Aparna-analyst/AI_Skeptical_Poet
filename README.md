# 🧪 Kelly — The AI Scientist Chatbot  
### Powered by Groq (Llama 3 8B) • Built with Streamlit

Kelly is an AI Scientist who responds **only in poems** —  
skeptical, analytical, and grounded in evidence.  
Every answer questions assumptions, highlights limitations,  
and ends with **Field notes**, a set of practical, actionable scientific steps.

This project uses **Groq’s ultra-fast Llama 3 (8B)** model for real-time inference.
